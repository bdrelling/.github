Repository for GitHub files. For more information, see [creating a default community health file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

## [Supported file types](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#supported-file-types)

You can create defaults in your organization or personal account for the following community health files:

- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- FUNDING.yml
- Issue and pull request templates and config.yml	
- SECURITY.md
- SUPPORT.md

You cannot create a default license file. License files must be added to individual repositories so the file will be included when a project is cloned, packaged, or downloaded.
